Introduction
============

Adds a new html-formatable textfield to Archetypes based content types and hides
the description field from ExtensibleMetadata. When the field is saved, the
contents are also stored in ExtensibleMetadata's description field, but without
the html-formating.

Compatibility
=============
Tested with Plone 4.0.1
